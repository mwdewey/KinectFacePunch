Libraries used:
KinectPV2
Shiffman's box2d for processing

To use, need to be on windows and have the kinect v2 sdk installed.
Also, I built the project outside the processing ide, 
so you need to include the processing.core library from your processing installation.

Instructions to use:
Sit around 3-6ft in front of the kinect, and close both of your hands to take a picture.
Open hands to let the image fall.
